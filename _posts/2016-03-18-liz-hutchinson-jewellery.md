Liz Hutchinson Jewellery

'Jewellery with an ancient aesthetic and a raw beauty' 

Liz is inspired by the Japanese aesthetic sensibility of Wabi Sabi, finding 
beauty in imperfections, rustic simplicity and irregularity. Her jewellery 
celebrates subtle processes like weathering and ageing which give her 
pieces a simplicity and 'rawness,' allowing the surface textures, form and 
tones to make an elegant statement. 
Living and working in the Pennines, Liz is surrounded by rivers and canals, 
rocky steep sided valleys and open moorland. It is these natural textures, 
subtle tones and rugged lines which emerge within her work.
Liz constantly gathers or photographs natural textures and colours that 
appeal to her ranging from stones, bits of bark, abandoned birds nest and 
rusty metal. By exploring these found objects, she incorporates their essence 
into her making process. Her fascination of symbolism, for example a golden 
bowl, is used a lot in her jewellery, often taking a simple shape or symbol and 
using it repeatedly over a long period. 
Utilising ancient Oriental methods that have been used for centuries, her 
work is a modern and minimal fusion of silver, black patinas and 24 carat gold 
to create organic highly wearable jewellery, which has been hand crafted with 
imagination, heart and soul.
