  Liz Hutchinson is inspired by the Japanese aesthetic sensibility of Wabi Sabi

  Finding beauty in imperfections, rustic simplicity and irregularity. Her
  jewellery celebrates subtle processes like weathering and ageing which give her
  pieces a simplicity and ‘rawness,’ allowing the surface textures, form and
  tones to make an elegant statement.

  Living and working in the Pennines, Liz is surrounded by rivers and canals,
  rocky steep sided valleys and open moorland. It is these natural textures,
  subtle tones and rugged lines which emerge within her work. Liz constantly
  gathers or photographs natural textures and colours that appeal to her ranging
  from stones, bits of bark, abandoned birds nest and rusty metal. By exploring
  these found objects, she incorporates their essence into her making process.
  Her fascination of symbolism, for example a golden bowl, is used a lot in her
  jewellery, often taking a simple shape or symbol and using it repeatedly over
  a long period.
